# Logistic Regression
This project was complete as apart of my Machine Learning masters program to complete a logistic regression using data that I collected. The language used python and created in a juypter notebook.

## The data
The dataset [Student Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health) comes from the data science online community [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The data was collected by a survey conducted by Google forms from University student in order to examine their current academic situation and mental health.
